    "The Coming Age of Conversational Bots\n",

    "\n",
    "We start with the modern chatbot. FastCompany  published a nice history of  a particular kind of software robot: [How The New, Improved Chatbots Rewrite 50 Years Of Bot History](http://www.fastcompany.com/3059439/why-the-new-chatbot-invasion-is-so-different-from-its-predecessors). Chatbots are really a conversation-based interfaces to services of various kinds. Sometimes the logic behind their inner workings is incredibly complex, but other times their operation is very service-oriented and shallow. Sometimes they are reading from a script, sometimes machine learning helps direct responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FastCompany article makes the point that while strands of artificial intelligence research has been obsessed with making a both that was believably human (or perhaps with the potential for one), the latest incarnations of these programs exist \"to help you get things done.\" They have grown plentiful using the scale of new platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and so on) and are fit tidily into their business interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    ">But over the past few years, chatbots have made a comeback. With advancements in processing power, bots now have a better ability to interpret natural language and learn from users over time. Just as importantly, big companies like Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are now eager to host our interactions with various services, and offer tools for developers to make those services available. Chatbots easily fit into their larger business models of advertising, e-commerce, online services, and device sales. Meanwhile, services that want to reach hundreds of millions of customers on a platform like Messenger will be helping to write the chat scripts.\n",
    "<br><br>\"A lot of the things that were barriers to us back then are no longer barriers to us today because of the evolution of the way technology works,\" Hoffer says.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Crucially, these bots are meant to be useful out of the gate, ... they no longer need conversation as a crutch for mass adoption. Sure, Appleâ€™s Siri knows how to break the ice with a few jokes, but it largely exists to help you get things done. Rival assistants from Google and Amazon donâ€™t exhibit much personality at all. Utility is winning out because the technology allows for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article ends with a comment about early artificial intelligence researcher Joseph Weizenbaum. Weizenbaum created something called ELIZA, a computer program that was modeled after a psychiatrist (or an \"active listener\"). \n",
    "\n",
    ">If the latest round of chatbots succeed, they might prove that Weizenbaum, the creator of ELIZA, was right all along. These machines are not warm and cuddly replacements for the human intellect. Theyâ€™re just another set of toolsâ€”an evolution of the apps that have served us for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, Weizenbaum didn't create ELIZA as a state of the art conversational program. He was, in fact, troubled by its positive reception, and later in life he wrote about the limits of artificial intelligence. The passage below is from his 1976 text [Computer power and human reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Power_and_Human_Reason). He closes the third chapter with this image.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Sometimes when my children were still little, my wife and I would stand over them as they lay sleeping in their beds. We spoke to each other only in silence, rehearsing a scene as old as mankind itself. It is as Ionesco told his journal: â€˜Not everything is unsayable in words, only the living truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful, right? For a data class, it's a great reminder that data will always exist at distance from lived experience. We can try to pile more and more data on a given situation or phenomenon. But no matter how big our data gets, we are still missing something. That's why we've been stressing how your choice of data is a creative act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we startup ELIZA, our dear friend Suman has listed out a number of identifiable elements to think about when you are designing a conversation. Again, not all of these will apply as we might be very functionally-oriented, but they are something to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Identifiable Elements of Conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element of Conversation | Possible Techniques to Compute/ Quantify |\n",
    "| ------ | ----------- |\n",
    "|1. Notifications/ Recalling relevant things   |  Time Series Analysis, Alerting, Keyword caches |\n",
    "|2. Learning topics in context | Topic Mining/Modeling - extract the topic from the words in text |\n",
    "|3. Understanding Social Networks (offline and online)  | Network Science, the study of the structure of how things are connected and how information flows through it |\n",
    "|4. Responding to Emotion  | Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "|5. Having Episodic Memory  | Some kind of graphical model, [see Aditi's data post](https://medium.com/@aditinair/episodic-memory-modeling-for-conversational-agents-7c82e25b06b4#.9k65cziqw). |\n",
    "|6. Portraying Personality  | Decision Tree, which is a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. |"

    "So far, we have made a lot of use of the cell structure of your notebooks. We've tried to organize things so that each cell or maybe each \"chapter\" of a notebook accomplishes some task. And we have been encouraging you to make changes to the parameters (chaging file names, or picking different numbers) and reuse the code. In short the notebook has let you repeat analysis by creating chunks of text that you can use again on different data. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a little clunky. It's great when you are learning, but it's not the way Python developers think. The main technique to share code is via Python's package mechanism. We have seen packages like Tweepy and Pandas. The creators of each have provided us with new kinds of objects to accomplish new tasks, from making requests for data on the web to working with tabular data. These objects extend Python's basic functionality and is probably the key to its longevity and broad adoption. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packages consist of simple data, objects and a category of thing we have used but not named -- *functions.* When we use `read_csv()` we are invoking a function that takes as *input* a file name or URL and *returns as output* a DataFrame. When we use `search()` from the package `re`, we are calling a function that takes as *input* a string and a pattern (in the form of a regular expression) and *returns* a match object, telling us whether the pattern was found or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are basically blocks of code that we will want to use repeatedly. Remember, Python structures blocks of code using indentation. Below is a simple function -- it basically adds 2 to whatever you pass it. \n",
