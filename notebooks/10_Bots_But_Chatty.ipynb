    "Today we are going to dig deeper into bots and start to look at them not simply as responding to events in the world (retweeting, say), but as \"conversational interfaces\" to information and services - voice. To get there, we need tools to help us interpret what people are saying to our bot and how we are going to respond. As we mentioned last time, bots have a wide range of interpretations - from information distribution to prototyping forms of social action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversationl bots are catching on in Journalism. The NYT had a significant project last year with Alexa, Quartz [has a new Bot Studio](https://bots.qz.com/), and the platforms are making tools for creating bots easier and easier. Now, the heavy lifting of turning speech to text and text to speech is a commodity API call to [Amazon's Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service) -- meaning voice interfaces are ridiculously simple to implement.

    "Befire jumping ahead 65 years or so from \"Audrey\" and \"Eliza,\" you could reasonably be wondering why it seems that so many digital conversationalists are female. I'd point you to an article in the Atlantic [\"Why Do So Many Digital Assistants Have Feminine Names?\"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/why-do-so-many-digital-assistants-have-feminine-names/475884/) which sites everything from academic studies that we take orders or attend to warning messages when they are delivered with a female voice, to outright sexism. I've seen a couple articles suggest that instaed [\"Genderless bots are the wave of the future\"](http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/04/28/genderless-bots-are-the-wave-the-future). These two articles are by no means meant to be representative of the writing on this. It is just hard not to see \"Audrey\" and \"ELIZA\" and \"Alexa\" and wonder.\n",

    "\n",
    "*The following introduction was written by Suman DebRoy. A similar accounting of the rise of voice interfaces [can be found here at moz.com](https://moz.com/blog/voice-strategy-guide)*\n",
    "A new paradigm is ushered in because there were inefficiencies in the previous paradigm, either present in the design or caused by evolutionary usage. Lets start with that 1980s supercomputer in your pocket- the smartphone. Think about the apps on your phone. You can launch every app independenlty. But there are also digital assistants trying to become a central intelligence in your phone, through which you communicate with some of the apps. Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft’s  all provide a single interface to control specific app capabilities. However, none of them allow us to do anything drastically advanced other than reducing the number of taps we make on a phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly is better than... *theres an app for that* ? The way humans perceive personal assistants is changing, as the word \"personal\" starts to take precedence over the assistant role. It may be only a matter of time until conversational agents invade consumer markets. There is [growing anticipation](http://observer.com/2016/01/2016-will-be-the-year-of-conversational-commerce/) because stats around user interactions with chat bots vs. app usage is incredible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the AppStore and Google Play [host over 2 M apps each](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/). Yet *on average, the number of apps downloaded by a person in the US every month is zero*. It seems like another paradigm shift is happening - the onset of messaging. Here are four main indicators that messaging is making apps irrelevant: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. App download slows considerably: \n",
    "    - Apps aren’t dying. But the entire space is collapsing, just like so many other industries before it. Its too crowded now, too hard to break in, numerous forced taps just for on-boarding and countless separate interfaces to keep track. Apps come with their own friction components — walled gardens, sign-up drags, untimely push notifications and re-installs. Both app makers and app users are getting increasingly frustrated with the ecosystem.\n",
    "    - App transition is costly. As a panacea, bots within WeChat enable its 600m monthly users to book taxis, or check in for flights, or buy cinema tickets, or manage banking and reserve doctors’ appointments without ever leaving the app. \n",
    "2. User Retention is poor: \n",
    "    - It is incredibly hard to make an app and keep people interested or engaged. On average, the Daily Average Users of an app drops to 77% within the first 3 days, and by a stunning 95% in first 3 months. \n",
    "3. Artificial Intelligence is improving: \n",
    "    - There are many things happening in the AI space, in the subfields of computer vision, natural language processing, algorithmic art, speech recognition etc. The field most applicable to bots is natural language understanding. \n",
    "    - Current state of bot intelligence is somewhat of an ugly marriage of bits of AI which kind of works and lots of hand coding ([but this can change soon, yes scientists are on it](http://www.wildml.com/2016/04/deep-learning-for-chatbots-part-1-introduction/)). To be honest, the bot world AI is still waiting for a  Pokémon Go moment with a giant breakout hit, but [we are getting there (in a fun way)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/28/chatbot-ai-lawyer-donotpay-parking-tickets-london-new-york?CMP=share_btn_tw)\n",
    "4. Messaging usage is outgrowing app usage:\n",
    "    - The big 4 messsaging platforms now have more users than the big 4 social networks! Can you name them ?\n",
    "    - [\"In 2018 alone, the four largest mobile messaging apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Viber) held 4.1 billion combined users, surpassing 3.4 billion users on the four largest social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn).\"](https://www.adweek.com/digital/heres-how-messaging-is-positioned-to-dominate-in-2019/) \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Bot design**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned, [Amazon offers advice about voice interfaces and designing conversations](https://developer.amazon.com/designing-for-voice). \n",
    "They suggest you begin with the purpose of your bot and then form stories about your users, what makes them interact with your interface -- \"what people need to and can do.\" (Note that on the Alexa platforms, the voice interfaces you author are referred to as \"skills\" - presumably meaning we are teaching Alexa a skill and that the interface is teaching us to behave in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Identify the purpose and capabilities**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Describe one or more scenarios in which people will find your bot useful and desirable. Determine the capabilities of the bot by asking the following questions:\n",
    "* What is the purpose of the bot? Why will people want to use it?\n",
    "* What will the person be doing before, during, and after interacting with the bot?\n",
    "* What will people get from the bot that they cannot get another way?\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Identify the user stories**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Based on the purpose and capabilities of the bot, identify individual steps and actions.\n",
    "* What can a user do, or not do, with the bot?\n",
    "* What information is the person expected to have available?\n",
    "* What are the ways a user can invoke the bot?\n",
    "* What features directly support the purpose?\n",
    "* Is there information that you need from other experiences, for example from a website or from a mobile app?\n",
    "\n",
    "They then ask you to outline basic scripts that \"show the conversation betwen the user and Alexa, like in a movie or a play.\" [Have a look at their guidelines and samples here.](https://developer.amazon.com/designing-for-voice/design-process/) They close the design process by outlining what you need to do to expand your basic scripts to fully articulate your application, getting prepared for when users don't act in the ways you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one formulates a script, it might be good to spend some time thinking about *what constitutes **identifiable elements** of \"conversation\"*. We can then, translate these concepts into code. Again, we are not trying to have these bots \"pass\" for human, but instead be able to carry out basic conversational structure to get a task done, say. Interestingly, however, people will try to converse with a bot EVEN IF they know that the bot's soul purpose is clearly transactional. \n",

    "**Scripted Bots, Decision Trees and Hybrids**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest bots are scripted bots -- like ELIZA.  Their entire interaction is hard-coded (the “script”) that determines what the bot can and cannot do.  The “script” is a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) where responding to one question takes you down a specific path, which opens up a new, pre-determined set of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's how you could design dialogue for a bot that helps you decide if you should have a cookie:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= \"http://static.twentytwowords.com/wp-content/uploads/cookie.gif\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In hybrid bots, some part of the interaction is driven by scripts (pre-written) but the majority is driven by an algorithm that isn't necessarily hardcoded. Instead, the model is instead generated from the current state of the data and then fitted into a conversation template, making it sound like a natural language response. This method can lead to hybrid bots, or fully automated ones. We will see ELIZA shortly, and here is an example of a fully automated bot - [NYTimes Minus Contex](https://twitter.com/NYTMinusContext).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Natural Language Processing becomes smarter, we will be able to do more fun things with bots at scale. The two key areas that is making lots of progress is (1) NL understanding: i.e. figuring out what the chat message means in context, and (2) NL Generation, i.e. generate a NL report from data (think about baseball or financial reports written by AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some basic principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "In consulting a number of online guides like the text \n",
    "[Designing Bots](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920057741.do) or a number of online blog posts \n",
    "[here](https://voiceui.fjordnet.com/), [here](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/ultimate-guide-to-voice-ui-design) and [here](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/a-comprehensive-guide-to-chatbots-best-practices-for-building-conversational-interfaces/), we found considerable consistency in approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most recommend defining clearly what you want your skill to do and to map out the flow of a person's conversation with the bot. The tools like decision trees will help you here. There is also a concern with the \"easiest\" way to do something. People, they suggest, don't want to listen to menus like you would in a phone tree, but instead they want things to play out in an order that makes sense. They also suggest endowing your bot with a personality... I suppose we should talk about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start with a simple bot that is entirely rule based and does not learn from its interactions at all. We will work our way to the ELIZA bot. Now, this kind of bot usually operates by looking for simple patterns of language tht its partner is using. We are going to spend some time with a language for specifying patterns. This language works in Python, JAVA, JavaScript, R, you name it. It's general and powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expressions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this portion of class, we are going to work with a \"language\" for expressing patterns in text. By \"pattern\" I mean specifying repetitions of symbols -- words or punctuation or sequences of numbers or any combination of these. Given a collection of text, for example, regular expressions might help you find dates or telephone numbers or URLs or email addresses -- all of these obey certain formatting rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, then, are a way to describe these formatting rules so that we can search a body of text for them. Sometimes we are doing this because we want to find lists of facts about people (email addresses and their telephone numbers, say), creating structured data out of unstructured data (a common theme in this class). And sometimes we appeal to regular expressions because they help us in the act of \"cleaning\" data -- we might be given a date column in a data set that contains dates in two different formats (y-m-d and m/d/y, say) and we need to transform them into just one consistent format throughout. \n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns we express might also be about content. Can we detect the gender of sources? Can we find new memes in a stack of text? Unlike the proto-natural language processing we saw with TextBlob, regular expressions deal with words as patterns of characters. There is no understanding here about parts of speech or grammar. Just patterns of symbols -- characters, numbers, and emoji, even.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trump's State of the Union Address**\n",

In a raw string, `\\n` is interpreted as two characters, a backslash and an \"n\".

    "The Coming Age of Conversational Bots\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",

    "<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*-uuhR1UX709LfUnDiS30Rg.png\"  style=\"width: 65%;\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the modern chatbot. FastCompany  published a nice history of  a particular kind of software robot: [How The New, Improved Chatbots Rewrite 50 Years Of Bot History](http://www.fastcompany.com/3059439/why-the-new-chatbot-invasion-is-so-different-from-its-predecessors). Chatbots are really a conversation-based interfaces to services of various kinds. Sometimes the logic behind their inner workings is incredibly complex, but other times their operation is very service-oriented and shallow. Sometimes they are reading from a script, sometimes machine learning helps direct responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FastCompany article makes the point that while strands of artificial intelligence research has been obsessed with making a both that was believably human (or perhaps with the potential for one), the latest incarnations of these programs exist \"to help you get things done.\" They have grown plentiful using the scale of new platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and so on) and are fit tidily into their business interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    ">But over the past few years, chatbots have made a comeback. With advancements in processing power, bots now have a better ability to interpret natural language and learn from users over time. Just as importantly, big companies like Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are now eager to host our interactions with various services, and offer tools for developers to make those services available. Chatbots easily fit into their larger business models of advertising, e-commerce, online services, and device sales. Meanwhile, services that want to reach hundreds of millions of customers on a platform like Messenger will be helping to write the chat scripts.\n",
    "<br><br>\"A lot of the things that were barriers to us back then are no longer barriers to us today because of the evolution of the way technology works,\" Hoffer says.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Crucially, these bots are meant to be useful out of the gate, ... they no longer need conversation as a crutch for mass adoption. Sure, Apple’s Siri knows how to break the ice with a few jokes, but it largely exists to help you get things done. Rival assistants from Google and Amazon don’t exhibit much personality at all. Utility is winning out because the technology allows for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article ends with a comment about early artificial intelligence researcher Joseph Weizenbaum. Weizenbaum created something called ELIZA, a computer program that was modeled after a psychiatrist (or an \"active listener\"). \n",
    "\n",
    ">If the latest round of chatbots succeed, they might prove that Weizenbaum, the creator of ELIZA, was right all along. These machines are not warm and cuddly replacements for the human intellect. They’re just another set of tools—an evolution of the apps that have served us for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, Weizenbaum didn't create ELIZA as a state of the art conversational program. He was, in fact, troubled by its positive reception, and later in life he wrote about the limits of artificial intelligence. The passage below is from his 1976 text [Computer power and human reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Power_and_Human_Reason). He closes the third chapter with this image.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Sometimes when my children were still little, my wife and I would stand over them as they lay sleeping in their beds. We spoke to each other only in silence, rehearsing a scene as old as mankind itself. It is as Ionesco told his journal: ‘Not everything is unsayable in words, only the living truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful, right? For a data class, it's a great reminder that data will always exist at distance from lived experience. We can try to pile more and more data on a given situation or phenomenon. But no matter how big our data gets, we are still missing something. That's why we've been stressing how your choice of data is a creative act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we startup ELIZA, our dear friend Suman has listed out a number of identifiable elements to think about when you are designing a conversation. Again, not all of these will apply as we might be very functionally-oriented, but they are something to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Identifiable Elements of Conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element of Conversation | Possible Techniques to Compute/ Quantify |\n",
    "| ------ | ----------- |\n",
    "|1. Notifications/ Recalling relevant things   |  Time Series Analysis, Alerting, Keyword caches |\n",
    "|2. Learning topics in context | Topic Mining/Modeling - extract the topic from the words in text |\n",
    "|3. Understanding Social Networks (offline and online)  | Network Science, the study of the structure of how things are connected and how information flows through it |\n",
    "|4. Responding to Emotion  | Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "|5. Having Episodic Memory  | Some kind of graphical model, [see Aditi's data post](https://medium.com/@aditinair/episodic-memory-modeling-for-conversational-agents-7c82e25b06b4#.9k65cziqw). |\n",
    "|6. Portraying Personality  | Decision Tree, which is a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ELIZA**\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, today we are going to work on the basics of a chatbot. Below we have the ELIZA program in Python form. Execute it and interact. You type \"quit\" to get out."
