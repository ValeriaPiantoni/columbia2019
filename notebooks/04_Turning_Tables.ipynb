    "*PDF (the Portable Document Format)* is really good for representing documents -- creating a standard like this was a huge deal when PDF was introduced. It began as a proprietary format developed by Adobe, but was released as an open standard in 2008. At first, it was a way to format text and images that was independent of the authoring application, the kind of operating system you were using or the hardware you had. In time, the specification included \"rich media\" like video, and now it even incorporates a seurity model with encryption and digital signatures. But at the end of the day, information that is encoded in a PDF is designed to be read by humans. The fixed format is analogous to having a paper docment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For whatever reason, it often becomes a vehicle for publishing data -- which isn't such a good thing. We have all seen pages of tables represented as PDF documents, and in such cases you start to see the format's weaknesses. Extracting data from a PDF will depend, first, on the kind of PDF it is. If you can \"select\" text from the document, you're in luck. There are several tools to help you get reasonably close to the data. If, on the other hand, your pages are essentially images, well, then you have to rely on \"optical character recognition\" programs that cluster black and white pixels, say, into letters and words and sentences.\n",
