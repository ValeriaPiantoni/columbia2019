    "A block of code is nothing more than a group of Python commands. Typically, this group hangs together because, when executed in sequence, they perform a single high-level task or a complete component of some task. Most modern programming languages have some kind of block structure. *Python identifies blocks through common indenttion.* This language requirement, forcing common indentation, also makes the code more readable. Remember, Guido wants code that can be shared, that can be read by others.\n",

    "\"So, how does it work? All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code, i.e. the statements within a block line up vertically. The block ends at a line less indented or the end of \\[your notebooks' code cell\\]. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right... There is another aspect of structuring in Python, which we haven't mentioned so far, which you can see in the example below. Loops and Conditional statements end with a colon \":\" - the same is true for functions and other structures introducing blocks. So, we should have said Python structures by colons and indentation.\" (Cribbed from the [Python Tutorial](http://www.python-course.eu/python3_blocks.php))\n",

In the cell below we have a simple example -- the code is indented to the same level (and the notebook helps you here) is all to be executed if the expression between the \"if\" and the colon \":\" is true. You can put any Boolean expression in here, including the operators like `and` and `or` and `not`. \n",
