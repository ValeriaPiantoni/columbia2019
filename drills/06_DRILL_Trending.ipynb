    "In class, we started to talk a bit about \"trends.\" What do we think it means for something to trend? For a trend to sweep across the nation or around the globe? Can we say something is trendy or in fashion? Or are we talking about trendsetting?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In social media platforms, trending is often reduced to popularity - a topic is being discussed at some time, in some region, perhaps among a certain community of people. So there is an implicit assumption that a trend is bigger than you and your posts, perhaps bigger than your city, but is something that is characteristic of a \"global conversation\". It's \"what's happening.\"<br><br>\n",

To start us off, we can use a web site called [TrendsMap](http://trendsmap.com). \n",

It is important to understand these factors before we embark on parsing and finding patterns in data about computed trends from Twitter. This is fundamental to any data science analysis - the incentives and procedures through which the data source generates and publishes data can often give us significant knowledge about how to interrogate it. \n",

This will give you hands-on experience analyzing trends, assessing their patterns and rhythms. On Thursday, we will flip things around and you will be asked to come up with trending algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The next section will be [methods](#Methods), where we will study some metrics that help **quantify features in the trend signal**. Example features include how long a trend lasted in some location, or how many geolocations it spread to etc. Note it isn't necessary that these features will reveal something \"interesting\" about the trend. The idea of this exercise is to help you calibrate your thinking about trends as a signal of social attention. In other words, assuming trends were a signal of \"attention\", what metrics can be used to compare to trends? \n",

    "\n",
    "Due to the incredible collection of images, status updates and other content that social platforms see everyday, Trending Topics are usually determined by an \"algorithm\" (a computer program or a set of guidelines for humans to follow... or a mixture). The role of the algorithm is to collect a substantial chunk of data generated on the social media site and strive to find **words/or phrases that occur more frequently than others, or words that are being produced with high \"velocity\"**.

    "We are now going to talk about several things to consider when designing a trending algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Trending algorithms often begin by creating a **sample** of tweets or other messages on a social network. Why do we want to work with  a subset of these messages, why not the whole thing you ask? Well, for one, the data might simply be too big to analyze quickly. In this case, some form of random sampling would help reduce the size of the data, but hopefully preserve the important patterns. As we have seen, Twitter, for example, offers users a random sample of tweets from their API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, depending on your notion of a trend, we might want to identify patterns in certain groups or communities within a social network. This means creating a sample of data from just these members, possibly using statistical sampling again if the number is too large. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Twitter computes trending topics for 400 places around the world. Some places are cities, some are entire countries and then there is a category for worldwide trending topics. By forming geography-based samples, we can ask what are the trending topics in Austin? In New York City? In the United States? Facebook also computes trends for geographic regions, but the restrict this to 5 zones -- Canada, the USA, India, Great Britian, and Australia. As we noted in class, this captures a large chunk of the English speaking world. \n",
    "\n",
    "So sampling, being the first phase of the trend algorithm, plays a critical role in specifying what trends you are after. For example, if you sample all Facebook messages originating from India vs. those originating from the USA, then there is bound to be significant difference in the trending topic list, because the status updates from these countries would almost certainly be different. This is true unless there is a global event that captures the attention of both nations simulateneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Personalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond forming trends from data on broad groups of users, Twitter (and Facebook until last year) further personalize trends to you and your corner of the network. These personalized trends can be based on \n",
    "1. Your location,\n",
    "2. The people you follow or are friends with, and \n",
    "3. Your interests: Pages you follow or things you LIKE/RT \n",
    "Twitter calls this sort of personalization \"Tailored Trends\" which is \"on\" by default. You can change this defalut and instead receive trending topics from any of their geographic lists. Your Facebook trending list is also personalized by default, but more importantly, it is *not possible* to retrieve a list of trends for the five Facebook zones in Facebook's interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that on Twitter, you can see what's trending in Paris even if you live in Boston. On Facebook, you cannot see what's trending in Australia unless you live there. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Luckily for us, the services that Facebook offers to its developers give us access to the list of Facebook trends for their 5 zones. These will be the subject of our initial data work.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Influencers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Trends might also be defined by *who* is talking about a given topic. If people are \"high profile\" -- having a large number of followers or perhaps always earning a large number of LIKEs/RTs -- perhaps their interests should be weighted more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this framing focuses on the high end, it might also be worth looking at the low profile users, perhaps as an indication of accounts that are \"fake.\" We might consider downweighting messages from these users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend Propagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "So the next obvious question is: why does a trend start in one place and spread all over the network? To understand this, we must delve a bit deeper. A sequence of activity resembles what we call time series data. Activity in a social network can be tracked in three levels: (1) Micro, (2) Meso and (3) Macro. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Micro: You tweet or RT something\n",
    "* Meso: All the people in Washington DC tweet/RT something\n",
    "* Macro: The entire network activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Meso signals resemble time series data generated from activity of a collection of users. We do not know exactly how such activity correlates with one other, but most previous research hint at information cascades as one reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information cascades** resemble a mathematical system where each node will make a decision of whether to forward the message/information or not based on its previous experience (is this a influential person) and the current signal information (is this tweet good enough to RT). In general, the *n*th agent considers the decisions of the previous *n-1* agents, and his/her own signal. He/she then makes a decision based on some reasoning to determine the most rational choice. The result is a set of activities on information propagating from node to node. \n",
